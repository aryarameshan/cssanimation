        <h1 class="head">Kashmir</h1>
        <p class="description">Kashmir is a historically and culturally rich region located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent, renowned for its breathtaking landscapes and complex political situation. It has been a point of contention between India and Pakistan since the partition of British India in 1947, with both countries claiming it in its entirety, while China controls the Aksai Chin area. The region has a diverse cultural heritage, with influences from Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam, and is famous for its handicrafts, traditional cuisine, and natural beauty. The ongoing conflict, fueled by competing territorial claims, insurgencies, and geopolitical interests, has led to violence, human rights concerns, and economic hardships. In 2019, India revoked Jammu and Kashmirâ€™s special autonomy under Article 370, further intensifying tensions. Despite its beauty, Kashmir remains a highly militarized and volatile region, with a complicated path toward peace and resolution.
